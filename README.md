# lovelyMoon

## Description
LovelyMoon is an ecommerce solution with a fully functioning admin panel to manage orders, products, and inventory.

## Technology
- Front-end Development is built with ReactJS using the Material UI styling library.
- Back-end is built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.
- The application is hosted on Heroku and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

## Future
I am looking to refactor this into a low-cost publicly used framework for small E-commerce stores. With needing to only restyle the front-end due to a modular server and controllers, starting a small e-commerce site will be fast, cheap, and easy.
